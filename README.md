Hello friend :)

I'm going for the "Exceed Expectations" grade.




I didn't make many changes in the CSS, I really liked the design the way it was already.

This is what I changed in the CSS:


  - padding, background-color and color of the 'Start Game' button.

  - background of the .chosed, .wrong and .lose classes

  - padding, margin-right, height and width of the .letter class

  - font-size, height and width of the .show class
